# touchtoggle
 Basically for my Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga L13. The touch screen can sometimes become a hinderance when trying to draw/write something with the pen. 
 
 As such, I am creating a script to toggle the touchscreen on/off via a one-click button, rather than heading to the device manager every time. This script is for Windows 10 only...so far. We'll see what further branches bring.
